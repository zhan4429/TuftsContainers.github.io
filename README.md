Containers have become a transformative technology in HPC, offering significant advantages in portability, reproducibility, performance, isolation, and security. They are rapidly gaining adoption in scientific computing and are poised to play a pivotal role in the future of HPC. 

In this virtual workshop provided by Tufts [Research Technology](https://it.tufts.edu/researchtechnology.tufts.edu), youâ€™ll learn the best practices of pulling and running containers on Tufts HPC, and how to build your own containers with both Apptainer and Docker. 

Topics include:
- What are containers and why should we use them
- How to use Singularity/Apptainer to pull and run containers
- How to build containers with Docker and Apptainer
- Environment modules (ngc and biocontainers) based on containers
- Advanced topics namely multinode-MPI and GPU containers
- Hands-on Demo
