## singularity/apptainer pull
### Syntax
Download or build a container from a given URI. 
```
$ singularity/apptainer pull [output file] <URI>
```

### Blast
You can find almost all bioinformatics applications from BioContainer's [Package Index](https://bioconda.github.io/conda-package_index.html)

[Blast](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs) is one of the most popular bioinformatics applications. Here is the guide about how to pull the latest version (2.15.0) from BioContainers and Docker Hub. 

#### Biocontainers
Bioconda is integrated with BioContainers. You can easily find the blast containers from its [bioconda page](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/blast/README.html#package-blast).

From the instruction, the pull command is listed below:
```
docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/blast:<tag>
(see `blast/tags`_ for valid values for ``<tag>``)
```

You can find the tags by clicking `container` on top of the page as illutrated in the below figure.

There are different tags for each version and multiple containers/tags even exist for the same application version. It is common practice to select the ones that were last modified.

To pull the image from BioContainers, we just need to run the below command:
```
## Default
$ singularity pull docker://quay.io/biocontainers/blast:2.15.0--pl5321h6f7f691_1

## To give a customerized output name
$ singularity pull blast_2.15.0.sif docker://quay.io/biocontainers/blast:2.15.0--pl5321h6f7f691_1

$ ls 
    blast_2.15.0.sif blast_2.15.0--pl5321h6f7f691_1.sif 
```

### Pytorch
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) is a powerful open-source machine learning framework based on the Python programming language and the Torch library. It's widely used for deep learning, a type of machine learning that builds complex models like artificial neural networks for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.
If you want to use PyTorch, simply pull the [official container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch) from Docker Hub.

```
$ singularity pull docker://pytorch/pytorch:2.1.2-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime
$ ls
    blast_2.15.0.sif*  blast_2.15.0--pl5321h6f7f691_1.sif*  pytorch_2.1.2-cuda11.8-cudnn8-runtime.sif*
```
